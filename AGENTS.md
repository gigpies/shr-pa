# SHR PA working agreements

## Scope

Highly experimental Rust PA management project for Raspberry Pi 5 and Linux Lite.
UMC1820 is a future target, not a prerequisite for DSP development.
Keep logical PA graph capacity, physical channels and measurement availability
separate. The 2026-10-05 configurable C-PA v2 increment supersedes the previous
fixed-2×6-only implementation scope. Preserve standalone fixed presets and exact
v1 ABI semantics; develop dynamic program inputs, explicit weighted mono sums and
independent outputs in this owner. Three/four-way LR24 and 4×8 are reference
profiles, never product caps. See docs/EMBEDDING_V2.md for admission, phase,
protection and persistent mute/prepare/commit/rearm ownership. The full DriveRack
function plan and measurement/acoustic acceptance remain independently tracked.
Do not add live audio or change host audio settings as planning/scaffold work.

## Modular development and next measurement work

SHR PA owns the PA module intended for later integration into GigPies. Develop and
validate PA processing and measurement here while retaining standalone operation.
Read docs/PHASE_ALIGNMENT.md when continuing measurement, P4/P5 setup or alignment
work: it records the requested reference/mic phase measurement and delay/polarity
alignment tasks, acceptance criteria and future GigPies boundary. Measurement integration through GP20 has software acceptance; configurable PA
processing is also integrated. Inspect the existing analyzer and contracts;
do not duplicate measurement in GigPies.

## Validation

The agent owns test classification and selection. Keep fast production unit,
contract, schema, safety, recovery and regression tests in the default suite.
Start with focused checks during implementation. Run the complete normal suite
for engine, render, shared model/schema, routing/persistence, concurrency, safety
or broadly reused component changes and before publication.

Historical research, auditions, exhaustive matrices, long benchmarks and
one-time evidence renderers are opt-in once their evidence is recorded, unless
they protect current production behavior. Run them when their assumptions or
protected behavior changes, or when explicitly requested. Document on-demand
commands. Reclassify slow one-time tests encountered in scoped work instead of
repeatedly imposing them. Report test classes run and intentionally skipped.

Normal commands are in docs/VALIDATION.md. No tests may open hardware implicitly.
Use the pinned toolchain. Keep changes standalone and avoid sibling dependencies.

## Publication

Follow docs/PUBLICATION.md before committing or pushing. Keep user state, private
media and generated artifacts untracked. Enable the versioned hooks when absent;
review new scripts in scripts/publication-policy.json and run the complete-index
publication guard. One-off bench runners belong in ignored artifacts/.

## GigPies task tracking

Use `docs/GIGPIES_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for GigPies work owned here. Keep each task plan,
implementation state, acceptance checklist, evidence and next action in the same
card; update it with the change. Shared integration tasks have one card in
GigPies, linked from contributor plans. STATUS, maps, handoffs and knowledge notes
route to task owners or preserve dated evidence; never mirror current task state.
Archive closed cards once; keep the active queue limited to open work. Reference
projects do not become GigPies runtime modules merely because code is reused.

## Reader-facing documentation

Keep README short and visual. Route musicians through the operating guide;
assume musical knowledge. Put protocols, implementation detail, validation and
work logs in engineering references or archives. Update the existing owning
guide instead of appending feature histories to the README.
